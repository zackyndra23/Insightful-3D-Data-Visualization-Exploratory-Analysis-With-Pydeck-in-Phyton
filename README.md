The increasing complexity of datasets in **data science** needs sophisticated visualization tools. In response to this demand, various tools and libraries have been developed **to help data analysts present data in a more intuitive and informative way**. In this project, we will explore the domain of **3D visualization using PyDeck** in an application to **illustrate the number of waste piles in Indonesia during 2022**.

Data visualization in three dimensions provides a richer and deeper perspective. However, in choosing a tool for the challenge, it's often difficult to decide whether a 3D approach is more effective than a traditional 2D approach. **What are the advantages and obstacles of each in understanding the number of waste piles spatial distribution of Indonesia in 2022?**

# Methodology

## Data Preparation & Data Wrangling to Prepare Data
* Defining the library
* Importing all .csv files that will be used for data analysis and visualization, then integrating the data into complete information
* Viewing all columns of the imported dataframe to understand the whole information
* Cleaning up the data in df3 so that it can be integrated with the main df. Then, information related to province_id can be unified
* Preparing the df4 dataframe in order to be integrated with the main df. Then, information related to regency_id, longitude, and latitude of regency can be unified
* Preparing the df2 dataframe in order to be integrated with the main df. Then, information related to the number of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (UMKM) and the number of workers/labors related to landfill management, wastewater, food waste, waste recycling, and remediation can be unified.
* Creating a new dataframe for visualization based on the province

## 2D Visualisation Using Folium and Plotly Library
* Creating folium and choropleth maps to visualize the amount of waste production by each province per day
* Create a new dataframe for interactive visualization of choropleth map using Plotly .go
* When the dataframe has no missing values, and columns with integer and float data types are correct, then 3D Data Visualization using PyDeck can be started.
* Creating a folium map containing whole information related to the amount of waste per day, the number of UMK's, and the number of workers/laborers in 2022

## 2D Visualisation Using Folium and Plotly Library
<br>

<div style="text-align:center;">
    <center><img src="https://github.com/zackyndra23/Insightful-3D-Data-Visualization-Exploratory-Analysis-With-Pydeck-in-Phyton/blob/main/(03)%20Discussion%202D%20Visualization%2001.png?raw=true" width="60%">
        <figcaption>Folium Vs Plotly Library 2D Choropleth Map</figcaption> </center>
    </a>
</div>

<br>

Figure. 1. A is the result of a 2D choropleth map from the Folium Library while Fig. 1. B. is the result of the Plotly Library. The difference between those two
is **the level of interactivity**. Fig. 1. B, when the cursor is moved to the chosen province, it will show information on the number of waste piles per day in
tons and also the name of the province. Meanwhile, Figure before can only be interpreted using the color index so that **provincial interpretation errors can
occur**. Then, from the level of color difference, fig. 1.B is **more distinguishable** than Fig. 1.A.

</div>

<br>

In this fig, using the Folium Library is quite **interactive**, when we click on the icon for the selected regency, it shows information on 3 parameters (number
of waste piles, number UMKâ€™s, and the number of workers/laborers). **Additional provincial and national percentage information data** can also be added and
displayed. In this visualization **we cannot find patterns** so it just provides the info from user configuration.

### Weak points and advantages of using Pydeck in 3D data visualization

#### Advantages:
* **Captivating 3D Visualization**
<br>PyDeck provides the advantage of more engaging and detailed 3D data visualization. This allows users to more deeply understand the spatial distribution of waste.
* **Enhanced Interactivity**
<br>PyDeck allows for better interactivity, allowing users to explore data and gain further insights through the use of features such as tooltips.
* **Flexible Map Configurations**
<br>With PyDeck, users have greater control over the appearance of the map and can easily set visual properties such as color, size, and height.

#### Weak Points:
* **Likely Requiring Advanced Coding Skills**
<br>PyDeck, as a powerful Python library, may require a higher level of coding expertise compared to simpler visualization tools like Folium.
* **Limitations on Some Use Cases**
<br>In some use cases, especially for simple presentation purposes or basic mapping, 2D approaches such as Folium may be effective enough without requiring the complexity of 3D visualization.

#### Brief Insights:
Through the use of PyDeck, analysis of the spatial distribution of waste in Indonesia can be carried out in more depth. The resulting 3D visualization **provides a richer and more contextual understanding of waste patterns and density**, which can be the basis for more effective decision-making in waste management in the future. While PyDeck has its complexities, the advantages it provides in spatial **understanding can be the key to more targeted and sustainable solutions**.


# Conclusion and Recommendation

Through this 3D data explorations, the article aims **to provide detailed insight into how visualization technologies such as PyDeck can help understand the spatial distribution of Indonesia waste piles in 2022**. By comparing with 2D approaches such as Folium and Choropleth maps, users will gain a **better understanding of the advantages and limitations of each approach in the context of increasingly complex waste management problems in Indonesia**.

### Recommendation
* Using 3D visualization by PyDeck, we can present **routes or locations of waste storage areas in a more informative and interesting way**. For example, we can use scatterplots to show the locations of waste storage areas and depict routes between locations.
* Using spatial data, we can visualize the route or location of waste banks in 3D. This can **help the community or related organizations in planning waste collection routes or designing waste management programs** by indicating the strategic location of waste banks.
* Leverage visualization to **increase stakeholder engagement**. This can be done by providing an **interactive platform or including features such as tooltips to provide additional information** about the data displayed.
* We can **recommend effective programs by identifying areas with the highest levels of waste production but whose human and organizational resources are still not sufficient to reach the goals** of sustainable development and good environmental management.
